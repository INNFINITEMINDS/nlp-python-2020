    "# Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other data types, text data never comes clean. Moreover, most of our downstream methods only accept data structured in a particular way. Because of this, before we do any computational text analysis techniques, we will always need to perform some level of preprocessing on our text data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different applications require different approaches to preprocessing. There is no \"one size fits all\" approach, and even if you use a program or module with built-in preprocessing steps, you want to know what it's doing (and not doing) so you can justify and/or change it. In some cases, it's better to do minimal preprocessing, to retain the valuable meanings stored in sentence structure and the like. In other cases, we want only a \"bag of words\", so more preprocessing is better. There are as many choices in preprocessing as there are in analysis (lots and lots!), so it's essential to understand the building blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, to do corpus linguistics (e.g., syntactic parsing) or neural network models (e.g., word embeddings), we usually want to keep sentence structure and different word forms, so we would just tokenize and lower-case words, segment sentences, and normalize text (remove URLs, etc.). In contrast, for simpler techniques like finding the most distinctive or frequent words--as well as for topic models--we would typically do all that plus remove stopwords and punctuation and stem or lemmatize words. \n",
    "\n",
    "To help you understand these choice points so you can assemble your own domain-appropriate preprocessing recipes, in this notebook we will cover the following basic ingredients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reading in .txt and .csv files\n",
    "- Tokenization\n",
    "- Sentence segmentation\n",
    "- Removing punctuation\n",
    "- Stripping whitespace\n",
    "- Text normalization\n",
    "- Stop words\n",
    "- Stemming/Lemmatizing\n",
    "- POS tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great starting point, but there is a lot more to learn about preprocessing. To acquaint yourself with a few more tools, check out `solutions/preprocessing_extra.ipynb` and the other resources listed in [the workshop repo](https://github.com/jhaber-zz/nlp-python-2020). To gain more practice and tools, come back for tomorrow's session!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do some review, but this notebook assumes you have basic familiarity with Python. If you need a beginner's introduction to coding in Python, please walk through the notebook at `solutions/intro-to-python.ipynb` *before* the workshop. "

    "\n",
    "Stemming and lemmatization both refer to remove morphological affixes on words. For example, if we stem the word \"grows\", we get \"grow\". If we stem the word \"running\", we get \"run\". We do this because often we care more about the core content of the word (i.e. that it has something to do with growth or running, rather than the fact that it's a third person present tense verb, or progressive participle).\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK provides many algorithms for stemming. For English, a great baseline is the [Porter](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/blob/develop/nltk/stem/porter.py) algorithm, which is in spirit isn't that far from a bunch of regular expressions."
