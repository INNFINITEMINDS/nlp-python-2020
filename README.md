# Natural language processing: An introduction in Python
## (work in progress)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jhaber-zz/nlp-python-2020/master)


## Overview

This workshop will equip newcowers to natural language processing or NLP (with some Python know-how) with a foundation for applying NLP methods in their work. The focus is on common steps in an NLP research workflow and user-friendly implementations of popular packages and methods. 

## Workshop goals

* Build intuitions about opportunities and limitations for using text as data
* Understand at a high-level:
  - how a few primary NLP methods work
  - what kinds of questions they answer
  - how to design and implement an NLP project
  - how to interpret results
* Gain practice with: 
  - preprocessing text data
  - simple methods using a bag-of-words approach
  - NLTK and (a little) SpaCy
* Acquire resources for further learning

## Prerequisites

We will get our hands dirty implementing basic natural language processing tools and methods. To follow along with the code—which is the point—will need some familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. If you haven't programmed in Python or haven’t used Jupyter Notebooks, please do some self-teaching before this workshop using resources like those listed below. 

## Getting started & software prerequisites

For simplicity, just click the "Launch Binder" button to create a virtual environment ready for this workshop. 

If you want to run the code on your computer, you have two options. You could use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) to make installation easy: [download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) . Or if you already have Python 3.x installed with the full list of libraries listed under `requirements.txt`, you're welcome to clone this repository and follow along on your own machine. You can also install all the necessary packages like so: 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
