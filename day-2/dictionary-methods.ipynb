    "# Dictionary Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know what texts are about? One of the simplest ways is called dictionary methods, which counts words of interest in text. This is useful if we know what categories we're interested in and can specify words related to them. It's also one of the most long-standing, and ubiquitous, methods in automated text analysis, so it's important to both understand the method and be able to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary methods are used for many purposes. A few possibilities:\n",
    "* classify text into themes\n",
    "* measure the *tone* of text\n",
    "* measure sentiment\n",
    "* measure psychological processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary methods are based on the assumption that themes or categories consist of a group of words, and texts that cover that theme will have a higher percentage of that group of words compared to other texts. Dictionary-based analysis is appropriate when the categories and the textual features (words and/or phrases associated with each category) are known and fixed--based on expert knowledge, crowd-sourcing, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use dictionary methods to do sentiment analysis, a popular text analysis task, on a corpus of Music Reviews (collected from MetaCritic.com), using a standard sentiment analysis dictionary. We will also use a weighted dictionary to detect concreteness in novels. Finally, we will explore using word weighting to get distinctive words.\n",

    "* *sentiment analysis*:\n",

    "* *Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Scores*: \n",
    "    *  a numerical statistic intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. As with DTM, rows correspond to documents in the collection and columns correspond to terms. Making TF-IDF scores is a common preprocessing step: it takes in tokenized texts and makes them ready for downstream tasks (e.g., topic models, supervised machine learning models)\n",

    "## 0.0 Introduction to dictionary methods<a id='intro'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind dictionary methods is that language reflects social position and culture: the cognitive categories through which individuals attend to the world are embedded in the words they use.  Words that are used frequently are cognitively central and reflect what is most on the speaker’s (or writer’s) mind.  Words that are used infrequently or not at all are at the speaker’s cognitive periphery, perhaps even representing uncomfortable or alien concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two forms of dictionaries: standard or general dictionaries, and custom dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of standard dictionaries that have been created by field experts. The benefit of standarized dictionaries is that they're developed by experts and have been throughoughly validated. Others have likely published using these dictionaries, so reviewers are more likely to accept them as valid. Because of this, they are good options if they fit your research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [DICTION](http://www.dictionsoftware.com/): a computer-aided text analysis program for determining the tone of a text. It was created by and for organization scholars and political scientists.\n",
    "    * Main five categories: Certainty, Activity, Optimism, Realism, Commonality\n",
    "    * 35 sub-categories\n",
    "    * Allows you to create your own dictionary\n",
    "    * Proprietary software\n",
    "* [Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC)](http://liwc.wpengine.com/): Created by psychologists, it's meant to capture psychological processes around feelings, personality, and motivations. It's also proprietary.\n",
    "* [Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA)](http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/): The free version of LIWC. We will use this dictionary today.\n",
    "* [Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER)](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment): a popular and free rule-based sentiment analysis tool tuned to capture sentiment in social media data.\n",
    "* [Harvard General Inquirer](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/spreadsheet_guide.htm). Multiple categories, including abstract and concrete words. It's free and available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, dictionaries are context-specific, and applying a dictionary outside its original target domain can lead to serious problems. A classic example was applying the Harvard General Inquirer to classify negative tone in corporate earnings reports--which [leads to serious problems](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2010.01625.x?casa_token=Vl0Os0QtDIQAAAAA%3AaxNRNAj4ajoocjLv_DCJMsS8GEA_jAqb_Z26h5I8g1yW0muShiPs_lglFbpHR-3AU1etsuyjhdN_ahZy). For example, the term \"vice\" characterizes an executive rather than immorality, while \"tire\" is not negative in the context of automobile industry reports. And some negative words aren't captured at all: the terms \"litigation\" and \"unanticipated\" are missing from the Harvard list. Enough of these problems means the results of our analyses will be wrong. So sometimes it's worth the effort to create a custom dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Many research questions or data are domain specific, however, and will thus require you to create your own dictionary based on your own knowledge of the domain and question. Creating your own dictionary requires a lot of thought, and must be validated. These dictionaries are typically created in an interative fashion, and are modified as they are validated. See references & links above to Enns et al. (2015) or Haber (2020) for examples of how to construct a domain-specific dictionary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will use the free and standard sentiment dictionary from MPQA (or VADER?) to measure positive and negative sentiment in the music reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step, as with any technique, is the pre-processing step, to get the data ready for analyis.\n",
    "\n",

We want to instead identify frequent words that are unevenly distributed across the corpus.\n",
