The idea behind words scores is to weight words not just by their frequency, but by their frequency in one document compared to their distribution across all documents. Words that are frequent, but are also used in every single document, will not be distinguising. We want to identify words that are unevenly distributed across the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular ways to weight words (beyond frequency counts) is `tf-idf score`. By offsetting the frequency of a word by its document frequency (the number of documents in which it appears) will in theory filter out common terms such as 'the', 'of', and 'and'.\n",
